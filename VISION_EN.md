# Project Vision

[Versão em Português](/VISION.md)

This document describes **the why, the who, and the how** of this project.
It is not a technical manual, but an alignment guide for users,
contributors, and maintainers.

## 1. Purpose

<!--
This section exists to make it clear **why this project exists**.
It prevents the project from becoming just a repository of files without context
and helps anyone — even without prior knowledge — understand its value.
-->

<!-- Explain **why** this project exists.

* What real problem does it solve?
* For whom is this problem relevant?
* Why does this project make sense within the Cumbuca ecosystem?

> This section should be understandable by someone who has **never heard of** the project.
-->

<!--
Example:

This project exists to help beginners understand fundamental
version control concepts in an accessible and practical way.
It addresses the common difficulty of learning Git only through isolated
commands, without understanding the context and underlying concepts.

Within Cumbuca, the project connects with the mission of open education,
serving as supporting material for individual study, mentorships, and
collective learning initiatives.
-->

## 2. Future Vision

<!--
The future vision describes **where the project wants to go**.
It serves as a reference to evaluate whether changes and contributions
are aligned with the desired direction.
-->

<!-- Describe the ideal state of the project in the medium/long term.

* How should the project be used in 1–3 years?
* What impact does it aim to generate?
* What would “success” mean for this project?
-->

<!--
Example:

In a few years, this project is expected to become a reference
in Portuguese for learning Git, used by communities,
independent courses, and educational initiatives.

The project’s success will be measured more by the clarity of the learning
it enables than by the number of features added.
-->

## 3. Target Audience

<!--
Defining the target audience avoids trying to please everyone at the same time.
It helps make conscious decisions about language, technical depth,
and project priorities.
-->

<!-- List and describe the main audiences of the project.

For each audience, answer:
* What does this person gain by using the project?
* What level of technical knowledge is expected?
-->

<!--
Example:

* Beginners: learn basic concepts without advanced prerequisites.
* Educators: use the material as support for classes and mentorships.
* Maintainers: find a well-organized and well-documented project.
